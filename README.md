encrypt_decrypt_credentials

There are some servers I need to login to in my job that require my credentials. I don't have a service account I can use. So, I will use this to encrypt some credentials for myself and import the encrypted creds without fear of co-workers stealing my credentials. 

Feel free to barrow and use it for whatever your needs are.
